# GOLD5 — Solid Gold Engagement Ring Research

A research dashboard for **finding gold engagement rings that can actually be verified**: solid gold (not plated,
filled or vermeil), a stated karat, a hallmark **and** a maker's mark, a published weight in grams, a real seller, a price
that makes sense against the gold market, a usable return window, and a path to independent XRF testing on delivery.

**Live site:** https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/GOLD5/

## ⚠ NO HALLUCINATIONS — the rule this project runs on

> Every price, weight, karat and policy on the site was read from the **official page linked next to it**, on the check
> date shown. If a value could not be confirmed from an official source it is **left blank** and published on the
> **Flagged for review** page — never guessed, estimated or inferred. Derived numbers (pure-gold grams, metal value,
> price-to-metal ratio) are computed by script from raw values and **recomputed independently by the security check**.

This statement sits at the top of every page. The check that enforces it is re-runnable by anyone:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py          # dashboard: provenance, arithmetic, money traceability, links, negative tests
python3 tools/check_hallucinations.py   # preserved docs/ archive: every value must appear verbatim in its evidence file
```

`scripts/verify.py` fails the build if a value has no source, if a blank cell is not flagged, if a derived number does not
recompute, if a dollar amount in the HTML cannot be traced to the dataset, or if a local link is broken. It also runs
**negative tests**: fabricated prices, fabricated weights and hand-typed dollar figures are injected on purpose and must
all be caught (currently 6/6). **Run it after every review** and log the result in `COORDINATION.md`.

## What the site contains

| Page | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing dashboard: the no-hallucination statement, the dated gold spot, headline counts, the best-documented candidates, and the category cards |
| `listings.html` | **All 24 rows** in one filterable table: price, karat, weight, solid-gold claim, hallmark, return policy, width, verification state, flags and the official source link |
| `sellers.html` | 14 seller profiles: contact details, return policy, warranty, payment, reputation links, and what is missing |
| `gold-price.html` | The dated spot snapshot, same-day cross-checks, and the per-karat value table with fineness and stamps |
| `calculator.html` | Weight × karat × spot → pure gold grams, troy ounces, metal value and price-to-metal ratio; loads any verified listing |
| `checklist.html` | The 12-point buying checklist, each point tied to an official source and to what the data shows |
| `analysis.html` | Findings: the hallmark gap, withheld weights, the below-melt case study, setting-vs-complete pricing, return windows |
| `verification.html` | The audit trail: what pass 2 re-fetched, what matched, what could not be read, and the checker output |
| `flagged.html` | **Flagged for review** — 19 findings plus every blank cell and the reason it is blank |
| `sources.html` | The full source registry: every URL, what it backs, when it was read |
| `archive.html` | Earlier sessions' sites, preserved unchanged |

## Data

- `tools/data_unified.py` — the authored dataset (24 listings, 14 sellers, 19 flags, 10 official references, 12 checklist points). Every value carries its source URL and verification state (`P2` = re-fetched live in pass 2, `prior` = earlier same-day capture, labelled as such).
- `tools/build_dashboard.py` — generates `data/unified.json`, `site/assets/data.js`, `site/assets/dashboard.css` and all 11 pages. Refuses to build if the data breaks the contract (blank value without a flag, unknown seller, bad karat, duplicate id).
- `data/unified.json` — the machine-readable dataset the checker validates.
- `data/live_check.json` — the pass-2 fetch log (what was requested, what it returned, what did not render).
- `data/check_status.json` — the latest checker run; `docs/verification/pass2-report.md` — its report.

### Current state (2026-10-22, pass 2)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Listings | 24 (20 engagement rings, 3 reference bands, 1 case study) |
| Sellers | 14 (6 retailers + Etsy + 7 Etsy shops) |
| Rows with a published gram weight | 8 |
| Rows with a published price | 22 |
| Rows with hallmark **and** maker's-mark proof | 0 — no listing shows it |
| Below-melt listings | 1 (case study, flagged F1) |
| Primary gold spot | $4,026.90/oz · $129.47/g at 19:26 NY, 2026-10-22 (Kitco) |
| Checker | PASS — 0 errors, 0 warnings, 4 cross-check notes, negative tests 6/6 |

Prices and promos move; every row shows its check date. Re-read the listing before buying.

## Archives (nothing from earlier sessions was deleted)

| Path | Origin |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | Session 638c9614 — 11 verified listings, verbatim evidence files, its own dashboard and checker |
| `pages/` + `index-090bae73.html` | Session 090bae73 — 13-page checklist-format guide |
| `guide/` | Session 3c8bb7ee (PR #4) — checklist site + research notes, preserved with its relative links intact |
| `site/listings.html` … | Session 37e8ff42's earlier dashboard pages, kept working against `site/assets/data-legacy.js` with an "archived view" banner |

## Refreshing the data

1. Open each listing and read the price, karat, weight and return window **from the page**.
2. Update `tools/data_unified.py` (value + `verifyState` + source URL). If a page does not render a value, leave it blank and flag it.
3. `python3 tools/build_dashboard.py && python3 scripts/verify.py`
4. `python3 tools/check_hallucinations.py` (archive check)
5. Record the pass, the sources and any irregularities in `COORDINATION.md`, then commit.
